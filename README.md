TUIDs - Time based Unique IDentifiers

SYNOPSIS
>     tuid64_s *myctx = tuid64_init(NULL);
>     uint64_t mytuid = tuid64_r(myctx);
>     ...

DESCRIPTION

TUIDs are unique identifiers designed for high performance concurrent 
computing.  TUIDs:

- can be concurrently generated by multiple machines without any form of IPC.
- use native primitive datatypes (32/64 bit ints) so they have high performance
  when used in database key fields.  
- monotonically increasing so their natural sort order is order of creation.
